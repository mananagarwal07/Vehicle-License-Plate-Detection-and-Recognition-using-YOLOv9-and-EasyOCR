# Vehicle-License-Plate-Detection-and-Recognition-using-YOLOv9-and-EasyOCR
The objective of the project is to propose an approach for a real-time accurate Automatic Number Plate Recognition(ANPR) system, which recognizes vehicle license plates. The system is based on a computer vision concept that combines Optical character recognition (OCR) and YOLOv9 deep learning algorithm.
