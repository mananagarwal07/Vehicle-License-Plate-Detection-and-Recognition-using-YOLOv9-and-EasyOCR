# ðŸš˜ Vehicle License Plate Detection & Recognition using YOLOv9 and EasyOCR

This project implements an end-to-end ANPR system using:
- **YOLOv9** for license plate detection
- **EasyOCR** for character recognition

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
- Ultralytics YOLOv9
- Roboflow for dataset management
- EasyOCR
- OpenCV

## ðŸ§  Model
Trained YOLOv9 on a Roboflow dataset of annotated vehicle license plates.

## ðŸ“¦ Features
- Image, video, and batch (zip) processing
- Detection/OCR confidence scores
- Training, validation, and visualization of metrics

## ðŸš€ Future Work
- Deploy via Streamlit
- Improve OCR with CRNN
- Add vehicle type classifier
